## Project Overview
This is an academic research and video essay project exploring themes of **life, power, and social inequality** through a philosophical and critical lens. The project focuses on creating content in Portuguese that bridges academic rigor with poetic expression, making complex social theories accessible to a general audience.

## Content Structure & Patterns

### Core Philosophical Framework
The project centers on three interconnected concepts:
1. **Life** - Defined as "the capacity to exist according to the delight of creative functions and dysfunctions, delimited by one's ability to influence surrounding reality"
2. **Ideology** - The current system that "produces rich people who decide lives, and poor people who govern misery" 
3. **Power** - "Kills because it is the absolute defense of the will of whoever possesses it"

### File Organization
- **Primary content**: XML format (`deepseek_content.xml`) containing philosophical conversations and analysis
- **Supporting media**: Visual assets (`.jpg` files) for video essay production
- **Output format**: Academic articles and video scripts designed for 10-minute video essays

### Writing Style Conventions
- **Tone**: Academic-poetic hybrid - maintaining scholarly depth while using visceral, metaphorical language
- **Structure**: Three-act narrative format (Life → Machine → Power mechanism)
- **Accessibility**: Complex ideas presented through concrete examples and dramatic imagery
- **Language**: Portuguese, with emphasis on rhythmic, impactful phrasing suitable for narration

## Content Development Workflows

### Video Essay Production
1. **Concept Development**: Start with philosophical thesis, expand through research
2. **Script Structure**: 
   - Act I: Establish life as creative agency
   - Act II: Critique ideological systems creating inequality  
   - Act III: Expose power's violent self-defense mechanism
3. **Visual Planning**: Contrast imagery (nature/urban, wealth/poverty, creation/destruction)
4. **Audio Considerations**: Atmospheric music, strategic silences, text overlays

### Research Integration
- Blend concrete data (economic statistics, social indicators) with philosophical analysis
- Reference thinkers like Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche without losing accessibility
- Use Brazilian social context (prison system, inequality data) as primary examples

## Key Patterns to Follow

### Content Creation
- Begin with powerful, quotable thesis statements
- Expand through three-part dialectical structure
- Include specific examples that embody abstract concepts
- Maintain dramatic narrative arc while staying factually grounded

### Cross-Media Adaptation
- Academic articles should work as video scripts
- Text designed for both reading and narration
- Visual cues embedded in written content
- Flexible format allowing print/video/audio distribution

## Dependencies & Tools
- No technical dependencies - content-focused project
- XML for structured content storage
- Standard media formats for video production
- Portuguese language processing considerations

## Critical Guidelines
- Never sacrifice conceptual depth for simplification
- Always ground philosophical concepts in concrete social realities
- Maintain poetic language that serves clarity, not obscurity
- Ensure content works for both academic and popular audiences
- Preserve the dialectical relationship between the three core concepts
